# Why is my map widget not showing anything?

This has been a very common question lately. So you got your website started, you created some ads and then you went to **Panel** > **Appearance** > **Widgets** and added a map widget.

If you're not sure, what I am talking about, check the screenshot below.

Then you went to your website and you saw this:

<br>
This happens when you don't have any real addresses on your ads, simply **try adding a real address** to any advertisement and you will see the results directly. And by real address I mean an address that you can be recognized if you write it on Google maps.

As an example, I added an address to one ad like this: Barcelona, Spain. And here is how it would look like:

<br>
If you have multiple addresses the map widget would automatically zoom out to show all of your ads addresses, just as I did here:

I hope that was useful. If you have any feedback please leave a comment in the section below.
