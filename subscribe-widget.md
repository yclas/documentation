## How it works

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/subscribe-widget.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![subscribe-widget-conf]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/subscribe-widget.png)
</a>

Example: A user visits your site and choose to subscribe to the categories "Apartment" and "House", in "Barcelona" in a price range of 0-400.000. When a new advertisement is published to the website, on the category "Apartment" or "House", in "Barcelona" with a price between 0 and 400.000, user will get an [automatic email](//docs.yclas.com/automatic-emails-sent-to-users/) (ads-subscribers) about the ad.
