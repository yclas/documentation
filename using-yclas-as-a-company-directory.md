This week we are going to look into another good way Yclas can be used. A bit of thought and we were able to figure out that we already have all the features to start a Business Directory using Yclas. The basic features provided by this free classifieds script are enough to get on with a good looking free or paid business directory. 

## Location Based Listings

Locations form an inseparable part when it comes to building a business directory. A location based category not only saves time of the users by taking them to the services available in their area but also gets rid of the extra fields in the business listings. Yclas does not only allow you to add unlimited location but also allows you to add as many sub-locations as you want under a single location. This means that you can break down your website in many tiny parts depending upon the locations that exist geographically. 

## Paid Listings

One of the major reasons for using our free classifieds script is the fact that Yclas allows you to charge your users a specific amount of money for posting adverts in selected categories or all categories. This allows you to start a paid directory or provide premium listings in free business directories. 

## Custom Fields

Yclas already has fields to enter general details of the businesses/services including name, email and phone no.  ***Update***[ Custom fields ]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-create-custom-fields)are now available with our [premium themes](http://open-classifieds.com/market/), ready for you to customize according to your preferences. 

## Unlimited Categories

We understand that there are countless business that can be listed in a business directory and within each category there can be hundreds of small or sub-categories and that's why Yclas allows you create unlimited categories and sub-categories. Each of this category can be either made free or paid depending on your idea and need. 

## Apart from above features there are a few more features that might help you in using OC as a business directory
