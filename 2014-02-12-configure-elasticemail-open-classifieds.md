# How to Configure ElasticEmail on Open Classifieds?

As we have posted in our **[blog](http://open-classifieds.com/2014/02/12/elastic-email-review/)** earlier, you could now have **[ElasticEmail ](https://elasticemail.com/account#/open-classifieds)** integrated into your e-mailing function in Open Classifieds. You would do that for multiple reasons. Some of them could be: your server can't send e-mails, e-mails not reaching users' inbox or you want to trace the e-mails you're sending.

### How it works:

Here are the simple steps you need to do to have it integrated into your website: 

1. Set up an **[ElasticEmail](http://j.mp/elasticemailoc)** account 
2. Go to your panel, **Settings** -> **Email**, switch **ElasticEmail active** **ON**, enter your account email address in API Username field and your account password in API Password field.
3\. Press **Save**.

Now every e-mail you send using OC admin panel will be sent through your ElasticEmail account.
