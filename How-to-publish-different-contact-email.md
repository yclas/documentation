Imagine you want to publish an ad and people that are interested to contact another department within your company but not you. You can create a custom field for this specific purpose. If you don't know how, you can follow this guide.
For that you can create a custom field. _If you don't know how, you can follow [this guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-create-custom-fields)._

This custom field needs to be called **contactemail**. If that field exists emails will be sent to that address instead of the user's email address.
