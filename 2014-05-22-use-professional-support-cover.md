# Professional support - how to use and what does it cover? 

_This guide is only for [Open-Classifieds](http://open-classifieds.com/)!_

If you made a purchase of a **[premium theme](http://market.open-classifieds.com/themes/)** or **[hosting with our affiliates](http://open-classifieds.com/hosting/)**, you would need to access our professional support system for your classifieds website.

If you purchased a hosting for your classified ads website and didn't get your free theme yet, then please refer to this guide.

After you're done with the previous step we are certain that a user account has already been created for the e-mail you provided us with, **check your e-mail** (check spam folder as well) and follow the links from e-mails sent by us, you will be able to create a new password and your user will be 100% setup.

#### Premium themes purchase clients:

Once you purchase a theme for your classifieds website, a user account will be automatically created, **check your e-mail** (check spam folder as well) and follow the links from e-mails sent by us. You will be able to complete your registration if you haven't already.
