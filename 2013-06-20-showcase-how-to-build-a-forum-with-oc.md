# Showcase - how to build a forum with OC

In this blog we want to prove how flexible and universal our script is by showcasing some unique and interesting sites that use OC for many different purposes.  Besides presenting what our customers did, it's time to brag a little bit about our accomplishments as well! Our recently launched [Forum](http://forums.open-classifieds.com/) is a **perfect example of how in few minutes you can adjust OC to serve not only for classifieds but also as a communication tool**.

With the release of the 2.0 version we decided to establish a forum to **make exchange of information between us and the users easier**. Thanks to this many bugs were identified and fixed and we got a lot of useful suggestions. You can ask there for **support** from other users. Here is how we've created it...

#### How to transform your site into a forum?

It's very easy and takes just few minutes!  

1\. Go to **Panel** > **Content** > **Translations**. There you can change all the texts on your website. Find all the places where word **Advertisement (Ad)** appears and **change **it to** Post**. Do the same with the word **Category** \-  **change** it to **Forum**. Click **Save**.

If you want you can also change the texts of emails being sent to your users in the Email tab e.g. instead of "Advertisement is created on [SITE.NAME]!" write "You've posted a thread on [SITE.NAME]!" etc.

2\. **Change the configuration for posting** **an ad**. Most fields used for publishing advertisements are unnecessary for forum so choose **FALSE**. In the last field write your user name for [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) (if you don't have account there you have to create it first).

3\. **Create categories** \- different thematic forums. E.g. we have: Support, Professional Support, Suggestions, Mods, Showcase, Community.

4\. **To configure a forum category where users need to pay to post threads**:

Choose the category that is going to be paid and click **Edit**. In the last field set the price for posting. In General Configuration (**Settings>General**) in the field **Moderation** choose last option: **Payment with moderation**. Remember to check Payments Configuration (**Settings>Payments**) as well - make sure your Paypal account is correct.
