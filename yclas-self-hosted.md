**Yclas Self Hosted** is a classifieds script that helps you run a fully functional classifieds website with little to no knowledge in web-design or web-development. It is a **free open source software**, so it's **ready for any modification** from developers or advanced users.

The purpose of the software is to give an **easy tool** for the everyday internet user to **put their classifieds entrepreneurial ideas into action** without the hindrances of lack of technology knowledge, funds or human resources.

The software **can be used for a variety of purposes**, from automobiles and real estate classifieds to wedding planning services and fish accessories. There is no limit to what you can build with Yclas Self Hosted.

The team behind Yclas is consistently improving the software, working on new releases, adding new features and trying to find good deals for future and existing clients.

As part of the team's efforts to **provide a full solution** we have arranged an agreement with our hosting affiliates, through this agreement you could purchase a hosting from them and with that you will have a fully functional **[premium theme](https://selfhosted.yclas.com)** from Yclas Self Hosted with three months of support after the purchase.
