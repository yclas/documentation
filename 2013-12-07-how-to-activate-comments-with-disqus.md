# How to activate comments with Disqus?

With Open Classifieds you can enable **social comments for your advertisements**. It's a really useful tool to engage people to your listing. What is more, it's really easy to post since you can log in with any social profile you have. For this comment system we use Disqus provider, which is free to use.

**Steps:**

  * Login to your **Disqus dashboard**
  * click **Add Disqus to Your site** on top-right
  * **Site profile**
  * **Site name**: this is for yourself, will appear in your Moderation/Stats Dashboard etc.
  * Choose your unique Disqus URL: THAT'S THE NAME in Your OC-PANEL
  * Go to your **OC Panel** > **Settings** > **Advertisement** > Fill the **Disqus field** and click **Save**.

![disqus](http://open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/disqus.png) 

OC will automatically insert the relevant code to insert your Disqus discussion (No need to copy/paste/embed the Universal Code provided). 

As an example you can check our forums comments, since are powered by Disqus ;)
