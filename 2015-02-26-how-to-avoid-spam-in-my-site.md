<br>
And lot worst stuff.... 

Spam it's really an issue, many times are automated machines or human data entry from underdeveloped countries where they pay cents to people to spam...sad but true. 

I am tired too! That's why at Open Classifieds we have developed a set of tools to help/prevent you from getting this shitty ads and making look bad your site. 

<br>

## WE HAVE THE SOLUTION!


### 1 - Moderate Ads


Best option is to moderate the ads. With this you are sure you don't get spam or duplicated ads ;) 

Go to the OC control panel and navigate to Settings > General > General site Settings. Set the Moderation option in Moderation On
