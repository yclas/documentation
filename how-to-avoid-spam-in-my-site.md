Spam is a serious issue, that's why at Yclas we have developed a set of tools to help/prevent you from getting these ads and making your site look unprofessional.

## WE HAVE THE SOLUTION!

### Moderate Ads

The best option is to moderate the ads. With this, you make sure you don't get spam or duplicated ads. 

Go to the OC control panel and navigate to **Settings > General** > General site Settings. Set the Moderation option in "Moderation On"
