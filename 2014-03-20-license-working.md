# Why is my license not working? 

Many users ask us this question after making a purchase, setting up the software and testing it. Then they would try to use the software on their domain and they get the **error**: "_Please insert here the license for your theme."_

What really happens is that the user makes a purchase of one theme, which normally comes with **one license** that can be used on only **one domain**. So, **one license = one domain**. Then they would use that license on their localhost or on a test site just to see how the theme is working and when they try to get the theme working on their main website they face this issue.

**What we would recommend?** You could simply follow those steps after doing your first theme purchase: 

* Download your selected theme
* Upload it to the FTP of your main website
* Activate the license there
* Activate **Maintenance mode** (**Panel > Settings > General**)
* Do whatever tests you need
* Deactivate maintenance mode

If you had **already activated the license** on a test site or on another domain, you could solve this issue by doing one of these options:

* Purchasing an [extra license](http://market.open-classifieds.com/services/one-extra-license.html)
* Purchasing more than one extra license (you can choose either [5 licenses](http://market.open-classifieds.com/services/theme-license-5-sites.html) or [unlimited licenses](http://market.open-classifieds.com/services/theme-license-unlimited-sites.html))
* Purchasing [another theme](http://market.open-classifieds.com/themes/) (this will give you an extra license, which you could use for another domain)

Your license can be used on any sub-domain you want to use your premium themes on but it wont work on another domain. If you are managing more than one domain I would definitely recommend you to choose the **unlimited licenses**, because it is the most cost efficient.
