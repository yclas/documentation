  * **Subject:** topic of the message
  * **Message:** body of the email, you can use formatting

If you need to change more advanced settings choose **Email Settings** where you can configure your email options.

When you hit **Send **your message will be sent to the number of recipients that is shown in the grey field at the top of the newsletter box.

All registered users will get your message as a **blind copy** \- details of other users won't be shown.

Please note that emails will be sent from server which may cause problems when sending newsletters to a large number of recipients. If you need to send many emails with a high delivery rate check a professional tool like **[ElasticEmail](http://j.mp/elasticemailoc)**. If you are not sure how to manage it, the following link let you know [How to Configure ElasticEmail on Open Classifieds]({{ site.baseurl }}/configure-elasticemail-open-classifieds/).
