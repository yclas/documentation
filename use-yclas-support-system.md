Before opening a ticket you need to enter a keyword or a topic. After you type the first two letter of the keyword/topic you will see all the related docs below, which you can click to open in a new tab. If you can't find the answer of your question in the docs you can press the button called **New Ticket**, which becomes enabled only after you enter one or more keywords.

When you click **"New Ticket"**, a ticket opening panel comes up, in which you could put the title and describe whatever you need help with.

### Replying to a ticket

On the support page you can see a list of all the opened tickets and their status: Open, hold or closed. A ticket is on _hold_ when you have received a reply from one of the support agents.

To reply you can simply click on the message shaped button next to the ticket and the reply form will open with all of the previous conversations. From there, you can read the full ticket conversation, close your ticket or place a reply.
