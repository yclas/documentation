You are building a large scale **classifieds website** with lots of categories and locations, but you're having a problem with adding them all in without spending so much time on typing each category or location and pressing enter with our quick category/location creator.

We have the solution for you! You can use an easy import tool to add all of your locations and categories with a press of a button. You simple need to follow those steps:

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></i> Warning: </strong> We do not recommend adding more than 100 categories or 1000 locations if you use shared hosting. Otherwise, your website will work very slow.
</div>

### Import Categories

1. Log into your **Admin Panel**.
2. Go to **Classifieds** > **Categories**.
3. Click **Import**.
4. Upload CSV files for your categories.
