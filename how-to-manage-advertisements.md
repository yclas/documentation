Go to **Panel**, choose **Classifieds** and **Advertisements** from the left sidebar. You will see the list of **all active advertisements** that are published on your site. The newest are on the top. Only 10 ads are displayed, to go to older ones navigate between pages of the list. What is more, if you would like to **manage your ads** you can choose **Panel > Profile Options > My Advertisements**. There is a list of your all ads.

### Ads management

On the list you see the **name**, **category,** **location** (where ad was published), **hits**, **status** and **date**. What is more, you have a possibility of searching for the adequate ads by using a field: **Search**. On the right side you have buttons representing different available actions. Just click one that you need and confirm when system asks if you're sure.

You can see the list of Advertisements marked as **Spam**, by clicking the orange button. There you can **edit** it, **deactivate**, **activate** or **delete** it permanently.

By choosing **Unavailable** you go to the list of ads that were deactivated or expired. You can **edit** them, mark as **spam**, **activate** them again or **delete**. 

If you click the blue button **Unconfirmed** you go to the list of the advertisements that were published by users but not confirmed by them with email yet. You can **edit** it, mark as **spam**, **activate** or **deactivate** it or **delete**.
