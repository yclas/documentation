<strong><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></i> </strong> This feature is available on our 2.5.1 release.
</div>

<p>With this feature, users have the option to change the primary image of their ad. If a user publishes an ad with five images, he can choose which image will be displayed as primary by editing the ad.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s say you have published an ad with two images. This is how itâ€™s displayed on the Listing page:</p>

<p><img src="//docs.yclas.com/images/primary-image.png" alt="primary-image" /></p>

<p>If you want to change the primary image, you have to click â€œEditâ€ on the ad and then click â€œPrimary Imageâ€ under the image you want to mark as primary.</p>

<p><img src="//docs.yclas.com/images/primary-image1.png" alt="primary-image1" /></p>

<p>This is the result!</p>

<p><img src="//docs.yclas.com/images/primary-image2.png" alt="primary-image2" /></p>

<p>Notice that you can change the primary image as many times as you want!</p>
