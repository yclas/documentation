I"ª<p>In this blog we want to prove how flexible and universal our script is by showcasing some unique and interesting sites that use Yclas for many different purposes. Â Besides presenting what our customers did, itâ€™s time to brag a little bit about our accomplishments as well!</p>

<p>With the release of the 2.0 version we decided to establish a forum to <strong>make exchange of information between us and the users easier</strong>. Thanks to this many bugs were identified and fixed and we got a lot of useful suggestions. You can ask there for <strong>support</strong> from other users. Here is how weâ€™ve created itâ€¦</p>

<p><em>For our forum we use Kamaleon theme with Flatly skin</em></p>

<p>Itâ€™s very easy and takes just few minutes!</p>

<p>1. Go to <strong>Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Translations</strong>. There you can change all the texts on your website. Find all the places where word <strong>Advertisement (Ad)</strong>Â appearsÂ and <strong>change</strong> it to <strong>Post</strong>. Do the same with the word <strong>Category</strong> -  <strong>change</strong> it to <strong>Forum</strong>. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want you can also change the texts of emails being sent to your users in the Email tab e.g. instead of â€œAdvertisement is created on [SITE.NAME]!â€ write â€œYouâ€™ve posted a threadÂ on [SITE.NAME]!â€ etc.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Change the configuration for posting an ad</strong>. Most fields used for publishingÂ advertisementsÂ are unnecessary for forum so choose <strong>FALSE</strong>.Â In the last field write your user name for <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>Â (if you donâ€™t have account there you have to create it first).</p>

<p>3. <strong>Create categories</strong> - different thematic forums. E.g. we have:Â Support, Professional Support, Suggestions, Mods, Showcase, Community.</p>

<p>4. <strong>To configure a forum category where users need to pay to post threads</strong>:</p>

<p>Choose the category that is going to be paid and click <strong>Edit</strong>. In the last field set the price for posting.Â In General Configuration (<strong>Settings&gt;General</strong>) in the field <strong>Moderation</strong> choose last option: <strong>Payment with moderation</strong>. Remember to check Payments Configuration (<strong>Settings&gt;Payments</strong>) as well - make sure your Paypal account is correct.</p>
