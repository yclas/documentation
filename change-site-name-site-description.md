When you [create a classifieds website with Yclas](http://yclas.com) you can change your site name and site description very easily. Both terms are pretty straight forward and self-explanatory. The site name carries the identity of your whole website and it is complimented by the description, which details your website's purpose.


**Whenever you're editing these fields, be sure to:**

* Check that the site name is the correct title of your website – this will be publicly displayed online.
* Check that your description matches your website's content and purpose.
* Take care and avoid typing errors, misleading/irrelevant input, plagiarism, etc.
* Keep the length of the description field under the max (indicated by the tool tip – 160 characters).
* Add a few keywords in the description – this could affect your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) analytics.

### How to do it

1. Go to your **website**. 
2. Login to the **Admin Panel**.
3. Select **Settings -> General**.
4. Enter the site name into the input box labeled **Site name**.
5. Enter the description into the input box labeled **Site description**.
6. Click the **Save** button.

✔   **The change is successful – general configuration updated.** 

Although site name and site description are important elements in your website content, but remember that you can always add more content to your site with the following tools: 

* [Text widget]({{ site.baseurl }}/overview-of-widgets)
* [Creating a blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-create-a-blog)
* [Add an FAQ section]({{ site.baseurl }}/create-frequent-asked-questions-faq)
* [Add a forums section]({{ site.baseurl }}/add-forums-section/)

Those are not all the tools, but we recommend using them if you didn't already.
