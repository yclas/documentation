**Q: Can I access directly to the Database?**

A: No you can not. Yclas is a hosted service and we do not provide direct access to your database. Think of it like Gmail: you do not have raw access to the data directly since it's "shared with many others".

**Q: Can I access directly to the Files via FTP?**

A: No you can not. Yclas is a hosted service and we do not provide direct access to files since all the clients have same files. This is not a traditional web hosting service. If you need any modification, feel free to contact us.
