## Why you should use Google Analytics 

It's useful to use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) (GA) on your website for several reasons. 

First of all, GA is the best because it's free and it's giving you much more data (who and when visits your site, etc) than any other free analytics software. 

Secondly, GA makes it easy for anyone managing a site to track and analyze these data. Its custom reports allow you to see your data the way you need to see it, whenever you need it. 

Lastly, everybody trusts Google Analytics data. Currently it's in the use of around 55% of the 10,000 most popular websites and 49.95% of the top 1,000,000 websites.
