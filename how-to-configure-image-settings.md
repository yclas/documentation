When a user uploads an image, OC automatically resizes that image, changes its quality and generates a thumbnail. More details about these settings are listed below: 

+ **Allowed image formats:** Set this up to restrict image formats that are being uploaded to your server.
+ **Max image size:** Control the size of images being uploaded. Enter an integer value to set a maximum image size in megabytes (Mb).

Each image is resized when uploaded. 

+ **Image height** (in pixels): This is the height of the big image. Note: You can leave this field blank to set AUTO height resize.
+ **Image width** (in pixels): This is the width of the big image.

A thumb is a small image resized to fit certain elements. 

+ **Thumb height** (in pixels): This is the height of the thumb.
+ **Thumb width** (in pixels): This is the width of the thumb.
+ **Image quality:** Choose the quality of the stored images (1-100% of the original).
