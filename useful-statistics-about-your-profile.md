There are a variety of tools available in our classified software. Since our 2.6.0 version we have improved the statistics panel, displaying data that will be useful and valuable to you.

## Site Stats

**Site Statistics** are available in your Admin Panel -> Panel -> Stats. You will be able to view the following: number of ads, contact details, new users, paid orders, sales and visits to your site.

## Advertisement Stats

Yclas provides comprehensive statistics about your advertisements. If you publish an ad you can see the stats for that ad, such as the number of contacts and visits as well as the overall statistics about your ads. 

**Follow these steps to see the stats of each of your advertisements:**

1. **Log in**. 
2. Click to the _profile dropdown menu_ -> **My Advertisements**.
3. Click on the stats button next to each ad.
