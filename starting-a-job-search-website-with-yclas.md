I love working with this script for one reason – flexibility. The code of the script is so easy to understand and so easy to modify that you can create almost anything you want out of it. In this article we will talk about the basics of Jobs listings and how we can modify the Yclas website to create a Job Listing website using Yclas script. This **[free classifieds script](http://yclas.com/)** contains almost all the features you need to start a job listing site. 

## Categories

When we talk about jobs, there are several categories we can divide them into – engineering, fitness, accounts, finance, logistics and many more. OC allows you to create as many categories as you want and manage them from a single admin panel. You are even allowed to create sub-categories which come in handy when there are a lot of options under a single topic. For example, engineering can be a category and mechanical, electrical, chemical, civil and so on can be the sub-categories. OC allows you to display these categories on top of the page thus making it easier for your visitors to navigate. 

### Selective Paid Listings

When I was thinking about the job listing websites using OC, I was thinking to create a different category where people would be allowed to post their resumes. But then that particular category might get overwhelming amount of spam. Now to avoid this, I figured out a way. I can put a nominal fee or $1 or mere 50 cents to put your resume on this page. This way not only can I control the spam but can also generate some revenue through a single category. Fortunately, there is a built in feature in OC that enables you to charge users a specific sum of money for posting an advert in any specific category or every category on your webite. 

### Customizable Sidebar

Having a customizable sidebar always helps. The flexibility provided by the OC code is so overwhelming that you can place or remove anything from the sidebar. A Facebook like box or recent tweets widget or maybe a calendar or even guest chat – this sidebar can take it all. You just need to figure out what does your visitors and website need and place the codes at the right places. In fact if you are good at coding, you might be able to come up with something unique like a ‘Add new advert’ option I saw on a site while browsing through OC daily Facebook Page feed. Yclas has room for everything you want to fit in. Although everything you will need to start a job search portal is already present in the script, but still if you cannot find anything you want, you can always opt for [premium support](http://open-classifieds.com//download/) and talk to our developers directly.
