**How to edit your profile?** 

It's so simple and there are three ways to do it: 

1\. Visit the website, log in and choose **Edit Profile** on the dropdown menu on the right of the header, as you can see in the example below. 

![EditProfileUser1](//open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EditProfileUser1.png)

2\. Go to Panel, **Profile Options** -> **Edit Profile**. 

![EditProfileUser2](//open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EditProfileUser2.png)

3\. Only the administrator of the website could use this way: Go to Panel, **Users** -> **Edit Profile** 


![EditProfileAdmin](//open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EditProfileAdmin.png)

Don't forget to press **update** when you finish editing your profile!
