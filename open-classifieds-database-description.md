For the past period we've been working on helping **developers** and **advanced users** to understand more how the information is distributed in Open Classifieds database and to give a better overall understanding of how Open Classifieds works.

Basically, this is a detailed description of the database tables created during the installation of Open Classifieds. Currently, the database supported by Open Classifieds is MySQL version 5.0 or greater.
