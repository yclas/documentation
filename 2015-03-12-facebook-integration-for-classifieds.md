# 5 - Facebook integration for classifieds

<br>
Hello! 

I am not a big fan of Facebook since I do not use it (used to years ago), but I understand that many millions of people use it on a daily basis. 

We often get people contacting or asking in the forums how they can integrate Facebook in their classifieds site. 

Today I am going to show you 5 different easy integration. 

<br>

## 1 - Login with Facebook

With this feature you will enable users to register/login into your site without creating a user or password. They will be able to login later with their account. Fast, simple and useful! 

This one is easy, you will need to have a [premium theme](http://open-classifieds.com/market/) and enable [social login]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-login-using-social-auth-facebook-google-twitter/). 



## 2 - Facebook comments

If you want people to be able to comment on your site using Facebook you can use [Disqus]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-activate-comments-with-disqus/) (which allow other social login) or the native comment plugin for Facebook. 

It's a simple to integrate since we have a guide [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/add-facebook-comments/) 
for you ;)



## 3 - Post last ads on your Facebook wall

So you can post manually your latest ads on your wall as Facebook posts. This can be a good idea, but you need to be careful in case there's many ads published on your site. 

I think the best Idea is to put only featured ads manually and sell it to customers as a feature or only post ads on certain paid categories. 

To automate the posting, we can use the RSS feed of your site. So the RSS of your site is something like http://domain.com/rss.xml or for a specific category something like http://domain.com/rss/your-category.xml 

The automation needs to be done with a third party APP that reads your RSS and posts it into your wall. Quick search on Google I found: 

* [http://www.rssgraffiti.com/](http://www.rssgraffiti.com/)
* [https://ifttt.com/](https://ifttt.com/)
* [https://zapier.com/zapbook/rss/facebook-pages/3796/post-rss-feed-to-facebook-page/](https://zapier.com/zapbook/rss/facebook-pages/3796/post-rss-feed-to-facebook-page/)
* [http://www.feedsposter.com/](http://www.feedsposter.com/)
* [https://apps.facebook.com/social-rss/](https://apps.facebook.com/social-rss/)
  


## 4 - Embed your site inside Facebook

Not sure it's a great idea, but for example you could embed the publish new form into a tab on a facebook page. 

To be able to use it you will need to be using [HTTPS]({{ site.baseurl }}/move-classifieds-site-http-https/), read how to do it here. 

The best answer I found so far is the one provided by [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/appsonfacebook/pagetabs). You can use any of our premium themes that will adapt to the width of FB ;) 



## 5 - Share/Like on Facebook

This is the easier one and the most used. We have a widget for this just add it in the sidebar and ready! 

You can also integrate any of their other tools like [share button](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button), [like a button](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button/) or something I use that is the [Like Box](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-box-for-pages), all of this can be used on a Text Widget where you can paste HTML.   

Hope this works! If I find any other useful integration I will let you know.
